## Game Description

This project is a mock of the famous arcade game Pac-Man, developed by [Bandai Namco](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/).

<br/>

The player will control __Jorge__, a yellow round being that navigates through a bar filled with ___tremoços___, an exotic piece of food that's rarely seen around. __Jorge__'s goal is to eat all the ___tremoços___ available to him. However, there are 4 employees, __Toni__, __Zé Castro__, __Baltazar__ and __Mariana__, that do not like to see __Jorge__ in the bar because he leaves no ___tremoços___ for the rest of the clients. But there's a catch: there are ___cervejas___, a special drink that, when taken, make the person incredibly strong, so strong that no one, including bar employees, dare to approach them. In fact, if the drinker touches someone they get knocked out, needing some time to rest and regain their energy.

## Planned features

- Player-controlled Character;
- 4 employees (the enemies) with different characteristics (movement patterns, color, etc...);
- Labyrinth (the _bar_) made up by walls that the player can't go through;
- Gateways on both lateral sides of the map that allow the player to move from one side to the other instantly;
- _Cervejas_ that act as a powerup to __Jorge__ and make employees vulnerable;
- The user gets points proportional to the amount of _tremoços_ he eats
