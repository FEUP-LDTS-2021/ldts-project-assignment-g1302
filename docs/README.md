## Game Description

This project is a mock of the famous arcade game Pac-Man, developed by [Bandai Namco](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/).

<br/>

The player will control __Jorge__, a man that navigates through a bar filled with ___tremoços___, an exotic piece of food that's rarely seen around. __Jorge__'s goal is to eat all the ___tremoços___ available to him. However, there are 4 employees, __Toni__, __Zé Castro__, __Baltazar__ and __Mariana__, that do not like to see __Jorge__ in the bar because he leaves no ___tremoços___ for the rest of the clients. But there's a catch: there are ___cervejas___, a special drink that, when taken, make the person incredibly strong, so strong that no one, including bar employees, dare to approach them. In fact, if the drinker touches someone they get knocked out, needing some time to rest and regain their energy.
It's Halloween night, so __Jorge__ and the employees are dressed as the characters from Pacman™, __Jorge__ is Pacman, __Toni__ is Clyde, __Zé Castro__ is Inky, __Baltazar__ is blinky and __Mariana__ is pinky.

## Implemented Features

>Already implemented features 

## Planned features

- Player-controlled Character (__Jorge__);
- 4 employees (Pac-Man's ghosts) with different characteristics (movement patterns, color, etc...);
- Labyrinth (the ___bar___) made up by walls that the player can't go through;
- Gateways on both lateral sides of the map that allow the player to move from one side to the other instantly;
- ___Cervejas___ that act as a powerup to __Jorge__ and make employees vulnerable;
- The user gets points proportional to the amount of ___tremoços___ he eats plus extra points for every ___cerveja___  

## Design

>Various sections divided n four parts each (**Problem in Context**, **The Pattern**, **Implementation**, **Consequences**).  
More details in the moodle template.

## Testing

>Coverage and mutation reports

## Known Code Smells And Refactoring Suggestions

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.

## Self-Evaluation

>Work distribuition between the group members (percentages are enough according to template)
